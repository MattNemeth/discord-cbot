# discord-cbot

Needed components: 
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* Code editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* GitHub account linked with Git on your local computer

Clone the repo on your local machine.
Contact me for a copy of the .env file (this will need to be placed in the root directory).
Join my bot testing channel (ask me for an invite).

You can debug the node app directly through VSCode and see your changes in this channel.

Once you've added some good changes, commit them to the master branch and they'll deploy to the heroku app.
